TADAHW
======

A custom hand wired keyboard that uses the TADA68 mounting plate.

Make example for this keyboard (after setting up your build environment):

    make tadahw:guilhermelimak

The layout is just the same I use on my tada, just copied here since the key layout is the same.

See [build environment setup](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/getting_started_build_tools) then the [make instructions](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/getting_started_make_guide) for more information.

## Firmware Format

Since this board uses a teensy 2 I just compiled the .hex and flashed into it using teensyloader.

## Teensy pins

If you are for some reason trying to use this on a board you must use the same pins as indicated below

- rows {D2, D5, B5, B6, D3}
- cols {B1, B2, D1, F5, D7, F6, F7, F4, B4, D0, D4, C7, B0, F0, F1}

## Flashing Instructions (Linux)

1) from the `qmk_firmware\` directory run:
```
$ make tada68:default
```

2) Plug teensy and press reset button to go into programming mode

3) Select .hex file generated by the make command and flash it

4) ???


## About

This board was born from an old tada with broken switches that I was trying to repair but ended up damaging the pcb, then I used the plate to house a new set of kailh burnt oranges and hand wired a teensy 2 to control it and used qmk to keep basically the same functionality from my other tada.
